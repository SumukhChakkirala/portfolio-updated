# Interactive Graph (React + D3)

This is a minimal React + Vite scaffold to run the interactive D3 graph component.

Quickstart:

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The D3-based React component is in `src/InteractiveGraph.jsx`.
- If you already have a React project, copy the component file into your `src/` and import it.
